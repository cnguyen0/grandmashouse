<br />
<b>FEES</b>
<br />
Chef Compensation. The Site enables chefs to connect with and provide food to Guests. Since each chef is solely responsible for all out-of-pocket costs involved with each Event, the Site enables chefs to set a per-portion price for their Event (a “Contribution”). Each Guest will pay the Contribution for such Event upon pickup. By reserving a serving in connection with an Event, you agree that your payment card or other payment means may be charged for the full amount of the Contribution upon pickup at the Event. A portion of your Contribution may be remitted to cover any Grandma's House fees, with the remainder to the Event chef. Contributions are non-refundable.
Grandma's House Fees. Joining the Site, creating an Account and creating and searching for Events are free. Grandma's House does, however, charge a fee to chefs for using the Services. The fees Grandma's House charges chefs are currently 10% of all sales revenue, which we may change from time to time. Changes to that schedules are effective after we provide you with at least thirty (30) days' notice by posting the changes on the Site. Grandma's House may choose to temporarily change the fees, waive the fees or offer discounts for the Services, promotional events or new services (“Discounts”), which may be subject to additional terms and conditions.
Payment Information. All payment information that you provide in connection with the Services must be accurate, current and complete. By attending any Event, you authorize your payment card to be charged in accordance with this Section. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY PAYMENT CARD(S) OR OTHER PAYMENT MEANS USED TO PAY ANY CONTRIBUTION. You will be responsible for paying any applicable taxes relating to your payments and will indemnify and hold harmless Grandma's House from any and all taxes, including sales tax, based on any payments made by you in connection with the Services.
Mobile Text Message Terms. The following terms apply to everyone who signs up to receive one or more SMS or MMS message and/or messages from Grandma's House or sends us messages via SMS or MMS.
When you sign up for Grandma's House's SMS list or RSVP to an Event, you are expressly consenting to receive text messages on behalf of Grandma's House, containing information about upcoming Events or Events that you have RSVPs to attend, in the following manner (the “Text Services”):
If you are a chef you will receive a text message notifying you each time a potential Guest RSVPs to attend one of your Events, including Guest details such as the number of servings requested.
If you are a Guest or potential Guest, you will receive a text message notifying you of information regarding any Event to which you have RSVP's such as pickup information.
If you signed up for our SMS list, you will receive text messages a couple times per week notifying you of upcoming Events.
You may opt out of the Text Services at any time by texting the word STOP to [(510) 254-3222] from the enrolled mobile device. If you do that, you will receive one additional message confirming that you will no longer receive messages from Grandma's House regarding Events. If you need help with our Text Services, text the word HELP to [(510) 254-3222] or call [(510) 254-3222].
We do not charge a fee for the Text Services; however, depending on your messaging plan, your mobile carrier may charge you for each message we send you or that you send us. It is your responsibility to know whether your carrier will charge you per-message costs (for instance, if you do not have an unlimited texting plan, or have exceeded your monthly quota of free messages). We assume no responsibility for charges incurred by your using the Text Services.
The Text Services may not be available in all areas at all times.

<b>DISPUTE RESOLUTION: ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND JURISDICTION.</b>
<br />
<br />
<b><i>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS</i></b>
<br />
Except for a claim by Grandma's House of infringement or misappropriation of Grandma's House's intellectual property rights, any and all disputes between you and the Company are subject to mandatory arbitration. We anticipate that most disputes between us can be resolved informally by following the informal dispute resolution process set forth below. In the event that we cannot informally resolve a dispute, then you and Grandma's House agree to be bound by the agreement to resolve disputes through the binding arbitration process described in this Section. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly. The Federal Arbitration Act governs this agreement to arbitrate and the arbitrator, and not any state or federal court, has exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising between us, including disputes regarding the scope, enforceability and/or applicability of this Agreement. This agreement to arbitrate governs all disputes between us that arise out of or relate to this agreement or the Services, regardless of whether they are based in contract, tort, statute or any other legal theory and expressly includes, but not limited to: (1) claims relating to advertising; (2) claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement; (3) claims that arise after the termination of this Agreement; and (4) claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class (“Disputes”)
<br />
<br />
The only Disputes that are not covered by this Section are: (1) small claims actions; (2) claims to enforce intellectual property rights; (3) claims arising out of or relating to unauthorized use of intellectual property, including but not limited to piracy or theft.
Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure: Before initiating arbitration, you and Grandma's House agree to first make a good faith and reasonable attempt to informally resolve any Dispute. You and Grandma's House agree that informal dispute resolution procedures will begin by one party notifying the other in writing of the nature of the dispute. The written notice of dispute shall contain all information reasonably necessary to engage in good faith negotiations. Consumers invoking this section agree to provide information sufficient to identify the Grandma's House account at issue as well as the meal and chef at issue, if applicable. If Grandma's House invokes this procedure, then it agrees to provide contact information for Dispute Resolution as well as information sufficient to put the consumer on reasonable notice of the nature of the Dispute. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith for at least 30 days following the date of the written notice of dispute. If after that period, the Dispute is not resolved, either party may commence arbitration pursuant to the procedure set forth below. Notices of Dispute should be sent to 1721 Broadway Suite #201, Oakland, CA 94612
Procedure for Binding Arbitration. If the Dispute is not resolved upon expiration of the 30-day period set forth in paragraph 1, above, then either party may elect to commence binding arbitration. YOU AGREE AND UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Grandma's House ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. Arbitration shall proceed as follows:
Administration. Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association and governed by its Commercial Arbitration Rules and, where applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“Rules”) as modified by this section.
b. Payment of AAA Fees and Costs. AAA fees and costs. There are filing fees and other costs associated with AAA arbitration. Each party shall be responsible for his, her or its share of the AAA costs and fees as set forth in the AAA rules. In the event that you are unable to pay the AAA costs and fees and you notify Grandma's House in writing that you are unable to pay the filing and other associated AAA costs and fees, then Grandma's House will pay those costs on your behalf.
c. Hearing Procedure. The arbitration will be conducted solely based on written submissions unless the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000 and the arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.
d. Location. If commenced by a consumer, the arbitration will take place in the county in which you reside at the time the arbitration is filed. If commenced by Grandma's House, the arbitration shall take place in the county in which you reside unless the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000. In that case, Grandma's House may elect to have the hearing in in Oakland, California.
e. Class Action Waiver. YOU AND Grandma's House AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR OTHER TYPE OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. This waiver will apply regardless of the type of relief sought (monetary or injunctive) and any relief sought shall be applicable only to you in your individual capacity. No arbitration shall be joined with any other and no aggregate proof or other class action or representative procedure is allowed. Unless all parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. Any injunctive relief awarded shall be limited to the extent necessary to resolve the individual Dispute. This arbitration agreement shall be null and void if this subdivision (e) is found to be unenforceable.
f. Choice of law. The interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and California substantive law. Any claim that arises out of or relates to the Services and that is subject to arbitration under this provision shall be governed exclusively by California law (including the law of the Ninth Circuit where applicable), without regard to a conflict of law analysis.
g. Attorneys' fees and costs. If you are the prevailing party in any arbitration, then Grandma's House will reimburse you for your reasonable attorneys' fees, if any, incurred in prosecuting or defending arbitration under this section. This subdivision (g) does not include any attorneys' fees incurred in any court proceeding that is related to or arises out of the Dispute, including but not limited to fees incurred as a result of a motion to compel arbitration or any post-arbitration challenge to either the arbitration award or the arbitrator's authority that is brought in a state or federal court. Grandma's House will pay you 150% of any recovery you are awarded in arbitration up to $ 2,500 above the amount of your award.
h. The applicable AAA Rules shall govern any and all aspects of the arbitration that are not otherwise provided for herein.
Modifications to this Provision. Grandma's House may modify the provisions of this agreement to arbitrate at any time. However, (1) Grandma's House will provide written notice of modifications; (2) modifications will become effective 30 days after notice of them is provided; (3) Grandma's House will not enforce modifications to this agreement to arbitrate to arbitration proceedings pending at the time of the amendment unless all parties consent in writing to the amendment.
