## Overview of project
Home chefs provide a valuable marketplace for different cuisines in local communities. Consumers are interested in new varieties when deciding on their next meal. Grandma’s House provides a platform for these two communities to meet. Home chefs share their love of cooking, decide their own work hours, and benefit from additional income. Consumers get to experience new cuisines prepared by their local neighbors.

Home chefs would be utilizing our application by posting their recipes on our platforms after they have gone through our sign-up process (which has an intensive vetting process so that we may protect them from legal repercussions). As for the eaters, they would long onto our website, find a post from a home chef, then proceed with a reservation with the chef for pick-up time! We’ve also included a messaging system and a favorite system so that the eaters and home chefs would have an easy time tracking recipes and communicating with each other.

Grandma’s House fosters a greater sense of community, because when it comes to food, love is the most important ingredient.

## Summary of Technology Decisions
..* Most of our features are “eaters” based since we want to create a product that will attract that demand for home cook meals first before bringing in hopeful chefs.
..* Terms and conditions must be accepted before creating an account since there are a lot of legality in this business idea, so we must ensure that we are not liable for the users and their actions online.
..* We decided to implement messages system to allow anonymity when communicating to each other without having to share personal information.
..* You are still able to explore the site without being signed in to allow non-users to experience the site.

## Stack
Our front-end is using React with multiple libraries installed. Be sure to `npm install` if you are cloning our repo and using our code for the first time. There are a lot of peer dependencies too so beware of that.
